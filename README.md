The **Prayer Time Web App** allows users to get accurate prayer times for any city based on their input. Just enter a city's name, and the app will display the corresponding prayer times for that location.

### ðŸ“± Use it like a mobile app!

You can use this web app just like a native app on your phone:

- Simply **save the browser page to your phone's home screen**.
- It will open in full-screen mode just like a regular app.
- The **cool feature**: every time you open it, your **last searched city is automatically loaded** â€” no need to search again!

This makes it super convenient for daily use.
